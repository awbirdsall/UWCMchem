Collaborative project implementing different changes to atmospheric oxidation
chemistry from [MCM](http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM/), for
Harvard course ENG-SCI 263, Fall 2015.

Uses [UWCM Box Model](https://sites.google.com/site/wolfegm/models).

Different individual branches of the repository should reflect different
pathways of the chemistry being changed.
